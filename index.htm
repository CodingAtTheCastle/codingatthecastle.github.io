        <h1>Welcome to Castle Coding</h1>
        <p>
            Every wednesday it is "Castle Coding" at The Castle.
        </p>
        
        <p>
        The event is for everyone that :
        <ul>
            <li>Is curious about learning what code is!</li>
            <li>Taking your current skills to the next level!</li>
            <li>Doing your own fun project!</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        
        <p>
            The format is "self study" but dont be afraid to ask for some tips and tricks from someone who knows just a little bit more than you.
